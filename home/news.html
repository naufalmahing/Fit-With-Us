                                Boris Johnson has announced that England will enter its third national lockdown in a bid to control the rapid spread of the coronavirus.
                                <br><br> 
                                The new strict measures, which come into force at midnight on 5 January, mean that everyone will be required to stay at home other than for limited exceptions, 
                                while all non-essential shops, including gyms, will be forced to close. The latest rules will stay in place until at least mid-February.
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout the pandemic, many people have turned to exercising outdoors, whether that's in the form of a daily walk or weekend cycle. 
                                Not only is it an opportunity to get out of the house and change your surroundings, it's also a great way to bump up those feel-good endorphins while following social distancing measures.

                                With lots of gyms shut and a new set of dumbbells proving nearly impossible to find during lockdown, performing a full-body workout has become a little this year. 
                                For those of us who thought this really, truly was the year to finally get in shape, 2020 did not go as planned.
                                <br><br> 
                                What makes things even more difficult is that few of us have the right space to exercise in. Not everyone has a garden to move around in, 
                                and not everyone can take over the living room each morning with family or housemates around. Keeping fit has become a tricky business, and we need solutions.
                                <br><br>
                                Luckily there still are plenty of simple exercises anyone can do to stay in shape, with just the space of a bedroom floor. 
                                You don't even need equipment - you can use books as weights or the bed as a makeshift bench, but even they are not always necessary - or recommended.

                                As we continue to adjust to our new normal in lockdown, finding a way to be active while staying indoors can be tricky.
                                <br><br> 
                                The government may have closed leisure centres and gyms, but it's still important to still keep active.
                                <br><br>
                                Regular exercise can be a great stress reliever, mood booster and aid in helping you sleep better, which is exactly what we all need in these uncertain times.
                                <br><br>
                                For those of us who don't have the luxury of a swish private at-home gym, then it's time to get creative and turn your bedroom, 
                                hallway or living room into your dedicated workout space.
